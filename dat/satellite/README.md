This folder contains satellite data. The layers include:

* ET24h - 24 hour estimate of evapotranspriation for the day of observation
* LAI - leaf area index layer
* NNI - crop activity anomaly layer (indicates nitrogen in cerials)
* PWSSI - plant water stress index
* SAVI - soil adjusted vegetation index

You can find three files for each layer at each date, a Geotiff and TFW for older GIS software, 
and a png file render of the gis data with an appropriate color ramp for visual inspection.
