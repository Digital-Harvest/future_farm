## This `future_farm` repository

This repository is for sharing information between Future Farm colaborators. It contains boundaries, ground sensor locations and histories. Hefty data archives may be stored on other services, but access to all resources should be documented here.

### Dev Notes

* SMS locations 0302 and 0303 in echo west should have sensors placed on them as soon as possible, the other three locations are proposed future locations when more sensors are available.
